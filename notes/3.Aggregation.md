## Aggregation

MongoDB Aggregations examples vs SQL

Import this file [agenda.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/ansp-mongo-workshop/mongo/agenda.zip) <br />

1.1 Count all presentations that have more than 50 likes
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agenda WHERE likes > 50 
```

```javascript
db.agenda.count( { likes: { $gt: 50 } } )
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate([
    { $match: { likes: { $gt: 50 } } },
    { $group: { _id: null, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
```

1.2 Get the all distinct tracks
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(track) FROM agenda
```

```javascript
db.agenda.distinct("track").sort()
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate( [ { $group : { _id : "$track" } } ] )
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate( [ { $group : { _id : null, tracks: {$addToSet: "$track"} } } ] )
```

1.3 Get the sum of likes for all presentations
```sql
SELECT SUM(likes) AS total FROM agenda
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate( [
   { $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: "$likes" } } }
] )
```

1.4 Get all tags and count the posts

Probably would use a separate table for tags and an intermediary table for the associations
```sql
SELECT tag_name, COUNT(*) as total 
FROM tags 
LEFT JOIN agenda_tags as at ON at.tag_id = tags.id 
GROUP BY tag_name
ORDER BY total DESC
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate([
    { $unwind: "$tags" },
    { $group: { _id: "$tags", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
    { $sort: {count: -1}}
])
```

1.5 Get top 3 tracks that have more than 3 presentations with more than 50 likes

```sql
SELECT track, COUNT(*) as total 
FROM agenda 
WHERE likes > 50
GROUP BY track
HAVING total > 3
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 3
```

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate([
    { $match: { likes: { $gt: 50 } } },
    { $group: { _id: "$track", total: { $sum: 1 } } },
    { $project: { _id: 0, name: "$_id", total: "$total" } },
    { $match: { total: { $gt: 3 } } },
    { $sort: { total: -1 } },
    { $limit: 3 }
])
```

1.6 Get top 10 comment authors, count their comments and the number of presentations

```javascript
db.agenda.aggregate([
    { $unwind: "$comments" },
    { $group: { _id: "$comments.name", count: { $sum: 1 }, "presentations": { $addToSet: "$title" } } },
    { $project: { _id: 0, author: "$_id", count: "$count", presentationsCount: { $size: "$presentations" } } },
    { $sort: { count: -1 } },
    { $limit: 10 }
])
```
